# lab-14

## Overview:

Today you will be seeding a database, then executing a series of commands to normalize your data into two tables: books and authors. You will execute a series of SQL commands, as demonstrated in class and detailed below, to normalize your data and remove duplications.

If the normalization is successful, the user will not be aware that anything has changed.
